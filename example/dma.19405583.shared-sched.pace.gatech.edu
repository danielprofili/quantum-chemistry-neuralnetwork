|       A note about this anaconda and modules: This version of           |
|       Anaconda doesnâ€™t play well with modules - once you load the       |
|       anaconda module, module commands no longer work (not even         |
|       module purge) unless you log out and back in again. We            |
|       recommend you load the anaconda modules last if at all            |
|       possible.                                                         |
|                                                                         |

|       This version of anaconda is 'latest', meaning we will keep        |
|       it up to date with current releases from continuum. We            |
|       recommend creating your own environment to guard against          |
|       version updates and changes. Please see                           |
